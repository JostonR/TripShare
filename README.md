## Motivation Behind this Project
Every semester, at the beginning and end, I see fragmented, independent google sheets frantically being started in different organizations to track students' flight logistics in hopes of finding a similar match to split the cost of their choice of ride-share.

I wanted to join the UM communities and find a make a global database of trip logistics so that students can connect with other students outside of their direct network. This would increase accessibility to split ride-shares leading to an increase in cost savings for students.

## Getting Started with the Platform

After making an account, a UM student should log their trip logistics and use the search filters to find other UM riders.
